Release Notes 
=======================================

|PRODUCTNAMEDOCRELEASEBOLD|

NVIDIA HBAO+ improves upon existing Ambient Occlusion techniques to add richer, more detailed, more realistic shadows around objects that occlude rays of light. Compared to previous techniques, HBAO+ is faster, more efficient, and significantly better.
